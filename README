This Perl script generates musical tones (in pairs or chords) to aid in the memorization of musical intervals. This script generates random musical tones and displays their pitch, in order to aid in memorizing intervals.
The user can provide customizations as to the type and number of tones generated, as well as their duration.

Future versions will allow for quiz mode.

Options supported are as follows:

    -v      verbose mode, provides maximum feedback
    -h      display this help message
    -d      duration, choose how long notes ring (in seconds)
    -r      range, how far apart the notes can be, within a range of r octave(s)
    -c      chord, how many notes sound be sounded (defaults to 2)
    -b      debugging mode, for greater verbosity regarding functionality

To do: 

    - Flexible user input parsing, e.g.: 
        - "m3" as well as "minor third"
        - "A#" instead of "minor third higher" (than G)
    - Fix octave/root display of "higher" or "lower" 
    - Add multiple interval attempts on single invocation of script (while loops)
    - Add range declaration for octave
        - Restrict octave range before generate_note call;
        - sub determine-interval should support 9ths, 13ths, etc. and onward.
        - Should 9th/2nd be treated interchangeably? Perhaps with a "loose" vs. "strict" mode
    - Add strict mode, where
